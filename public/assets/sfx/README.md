# Local SFX placeholders

Add your fallback sound effects here. The application expects mp3 files in `public/assets/sfx/default/`:

- `success.mp3`
- `encourage.mp3`
- `levelup.mp3`
- `streak.mp3`

These files are not bundled in the repository; drop your own audio assets with those names into the `default` directory before building for production if you want the offline SFX fallback.
